# Horizontal Screen Coverage

How much horizontal space the terminal should use. When this is below 100, the terminal is centered (can be changed using the [Horizontal Align](/settings/horizontal-align)) setting.

This can also be above 100, which can be useful to compensate for the window not always taking a 100% of the screen width, due to the terminal being bound to column widths (eg. try 100.5 or 101).

```json
{
	"HorizontalScreenCoverage": 80
}
```
